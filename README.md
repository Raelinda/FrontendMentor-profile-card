# FrontendMentor newbie challenge



This challenge required knowledge of html/css. The trickiest part for me was making everything responsive except the card's background image so that it wouldn't resize at larger screen sizes and screw up the layout. If anyone knows a better way than the one I used, sing out.

## Update:
When I first loaded my repo onto github pages, the images didn't load. They worked on my local repo (Atom).

My images are in a file called "images" so the path I used was </images/my-cool-image.jpg>.

I googled and tried a bunch of different things until I arrived at this solution: 
Adjust all image paths one level down. For example: Change </images/my-cool-image.jpg> to <images/my-cool-image.jpg>.

Since this would screw things up on my local repo the only solution I can think of is to create a branch with the adjusted image paths to put on github pages.  Kind of annoying and inelegant. 

If someone has a better solution, sing out.
